# Craftworx-A18-Modlets
Stand-alone modlets for 7 Days to Die from the Craftworx mod

Current available modlets:

- Quicker Crossbow - increases the reload speed on the iron and compound crossbows to be a bit more viable in combat

- Double-barreled Shotgun Melee - Removes the aiming mechanic from the double-barreled shotgun and replaces it with a melee attack, useful for when you run out of ammo, or those first two shots don't drop your taget. It's not fast, but it works.

- Scrap Iron Items - Scrap iron tools (axe, pickaxe, shovel, and knife) and archery ammo (arros and bolts, crafted from scrap iron, wood, and scrap polymers). Balanced to bridge the gap between stone and iron tools and ammo.

- Quality of Life (QoL) - Makes beakers, jail doors, and jail bars craftable through certain perks. Increases wood harvest from empty pallets and pallet stacks, with a small chance to also harvest nails. Adds harvesting of crushed cars.
